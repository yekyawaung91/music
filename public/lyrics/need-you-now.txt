[00:37]Picture perfect memories,
[00:39]Scattered all around the floor,
[00:45]Reaching for the phone cause, I can't fight it any more
[00:53]And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
[01:02]For me it happens all the time
[01:07]It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
[01:16]Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
[01:25]And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
[01:41]Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door
[01:50]Wishing you'd come sweepin' in the way you did before
[01:58]And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
[02:07]For me it happens all the time
[02:12]It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk, and I need you now
[02:21]Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
[02:30]And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
[02:54]Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all
[03:03]It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
[03:11]And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
[03:21]And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
[03:33]I just need you now
[03:52]Oh baby I need you now
